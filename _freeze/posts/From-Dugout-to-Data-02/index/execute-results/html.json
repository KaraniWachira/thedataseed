With our upcoming friendly against MMU Stommers Baseball Club on August 30th, 2025, at The Nairobi’s Field of Dreams, it’s the perfect time to dive into matrices a fundamental R concept that can help us organize and analyze game data efficiently.\n\n![Image source Nairobi Baseball Community Championship series 2025](player.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThink of a matrix like a baseball score sheet: rows represent innings, columns represent teams, and each cell holds the runs scored. This structured layout makes it easy to see patterns, compare performances, and make strategic decisions. In this article, we’ll build and manipulate baseball-themed matrices in R, making the stats come alive just like plays on the diamond.\n\n### **Stepping Up to the Plate: Setting Up the Score Matrix**\n\nLet’s start by creating a matrix to represent the runs scored by Thika Rangers and MMU Stommers in the first three innings in a hypothetical game scenario.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nruns <- matrix(\n  c(2, 1, 0,  # Thika Rangers runs in innings 1–3\n    1, 0, 3), # MMU Stommers runs in innings 1–3\n  nrow = 2,          # Two teams\n  byrow = TRUE       # Fill by row (team-wise)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor clear communication lets give meaningful names to the rows and columns we created in the Matrix\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Name the rows and columns\nrownames(runs) <- c(\"Thika Rangers\", \"MMU Stommers\")\ncolnames(runs) <- c(\"Inning1\", \"Inning2\", \"Inning3\")\n\nruns\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n              Inning1 Inning2 Inning3\nThika Rangers       2       1       0\nMMU Stommers        1       0       3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`nrow = 2` means we have two rows (teams), `byrow = TRUE` fills the matrix row by row. We’ve labeled rows as Thika Rangers and MMU Stommers, and columns as the **innings**. This makes our matrix readable, like a baseball box score.\n\n### **Arithmetic Operations on Matrices**\n\nWe can use matrices to quickly compare performance between teams. In our scenario let’s calculate the difference in runs per inning and observe the output we get from this operation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Difference in runs: Rangers - Stommers\nrun_diff <- runs[1, ] - runs[2, ]\nrun_diff\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nInning1 Inning2 Inning3 \n      1       1      -3 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInInning1, Rangers scored 1 more run than Stommers. In Inning 2, Rangers were outscored by 1 run hence the negative value and In the Inning3, Rangers scored 3 more runs indicating a dominant offensive as the game intensifies. This kind of quick arithmetic can show which innings we need to focus on improving.\n\n### **Extending the Scoreboard: Adding New Innings or Teams**\n\nAfter the game we will definitely need to sum up the total runs scored. Let’s add a Total Runs column to sum up each team’s runs, and a New Team row for a future scrimmage opponent.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Adding a Total column\ntotal_runs <- c(rowSums(runs))\nruns <- cbind(runs, Total = total_runs)\n\n# Adding a new team(wreckers) row\nnew_team <- c(0, 0, 0, 0) # no runs yet\nruns <- rbind(runs, wreckers = new_team)\n```\n:::\n\n\n`rowSums(runs)` calculates total runs for each team, `cbind()` adds that as a Total column, `rbind()` adds a new row for NewOpponents, wreckers, ready for when we record their stats in a future game.\n\n### **Calling the Plays: Extracting Specific Scores**\n\nWe can pull specific data from the matrix, just like checking a scorecard. Take an instance where the coach wants to know what inning did the team perform best in offense achieving more runs or what inning our opponent scored most of their runs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Runs scored by Thika Rangers in inning2\nruns[\"Thika Rangers\", \"Inning2\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#All runs scored by stommers in inning 3\nruns[\"MMU Stommers\", 3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# All runs scored by Thika Rangers after inning 3\nruns[\"Thika Rangers\",]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nInning1 Inning2 Inning3   Total \n      2       1       0       3 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this code, we start by extracting the runs scored by Thika Rangers in *Inning 2* using `runs[\"Thika Rangers\", \"Inning2\"]`, which uses both the row name `\"Thika Rangers\"` and the column name `\"Inning2\"` to return a single numeric value representing that inning’s score. Next, `runs[\"MMU Stommers\", 3]` selects the runs scored by MMU Stommers in *Inning 3*, but here instead of the column name we use the column index `3`, which corresponds to `\"Inning3\"`, showing how both names and numeric indices can be used for selection. Finally, `runs[\"Thika Rangers\", ]` retrieves all runs scored by Thika Rangers across *all innings* by specifying the row name and leaving the column index empty, meaning we keep the entire row as a vector of their inning-by-inning scores. This combination of row and column indexing is a powerful way to pinpoint or summarize specific performance data in R’s matrices.\n\n### **Wrapping Up the Innings: What’s Next in the Series**\n\nAs you have seen, matrices in R give us a powerful way to represent and manipulate baseball game data making it easy to extract insights, project future performance, and test “what if” scenarios.\n\nBut baseball isn’t just about the numbers, it’s also about what those numbers represent. In our next installment, we’ll move from raw numeric counts to **factors**, a statistical data type used to store categorical variables which in our case we will be representing categorical baseball data such as player positions, pitch types, or weather conditions during a game. Think of it as shifting focus from *how many runs* to *what kind of plays* shape the game because just like a well-timed home run, knowing the categories can be a game-changer.\n",
