    "section": "",
    "text": "In our From Dugout to Data series, we’re stepping up to the plate again, this time to explore matrices in R. With our upcoming friendly against MMU Stommers Baseball Club on August 30th, 2025, at The Nairobi’s Field of Dreams, it’s the perfect time to dive into matrices a fundamental R concept that can help us organize and analyze game data efficiently.\n\n\n\nImage source Nairobi Baseball Community Championship series 2025\n\n\nThink of a matrix like a baseball score sheet: rows represent innings, columns represent teams, and each cell holds the runs scored. This structured layout makes it easy to see patterns, compare performances, and make strategic decisions. In this article, we’ll build and manipulate baseball-themed matrices in R, making the stats come alive just like plays on the diamond.\n\nStepping Up to the Plate: Setting Up the Score Matrix\nLet’s start by creating a matrix to represent the runs scored by Thika Rangers and MMU Stommers in the first three innings in a hypothetical game scenario.\n\nruns &lt;- matrix(\n  c(2, 1, 0,  # Thika Rangers runs in innings 1–3\n    1, 0, 3), # MMU Stommers runs in innings 1–3\n  nrow = 2,          # Two teams\n  byrow = TRUE       # Fill by row (team-wise)\n)\n\nFor clear communication lets give meaningful names to the rows and columns we created in the Matrix\n\n# Name the rows and columns\nrownames(runs) &lt;- c(\"Thika Rangers\", \"MMU Stommers\")\ncolnames(runs) &lt;- c(\"Inning1\", \"Inning2\", \"Inning3\")\n\nruns\n\n              Inning1 Inning2 Inning3\nThika Rangers       2       1       0\nMMU Stommers        1       0       3\n\n\nnrow = 2 means we have two rows (teams), byrow = TRUE fills the matrix row by row. We’ve labeled rows as Thika Rangers and MMU Stommers, and columns as the innings. This makes our matrix readable, like a baseball box score.\n\n\nArithmetic Operations on Matrices\nWe can use matrices to quickly compare performance between teams. In our scenario let’s calculate the difference in runs per inning and observe the output we get from this operation.\n\n# Difference in runs: Rangers - Stommers\nrun_diff &lt;- runs[1, ] - runs[2, ]\nrun_diff\n\nInning1 Inning2 Inning3 \n      1       1      -3 \n\n\nInInning1, Rangers scored 1 more run than Stommers. In Inning 2, Rangers were outscored by 1 run hence the negative value and In the Inning3, Rangers scored 3 more runs indicating a dominant offensive as the game intensifies. This kind of quick arithmetic can show which innings we need to focus on improving.\n\n\nExtending the Scoreboard: Adding New Innings or Teams\nAfter the game we will definitely need to sum up the total runs scored. Let’s add a Total Runs column to sum up each team’s runs, and a New Team row for a future scrimmage opponent.\n\n# Adding a Total column\ntotal_runs &lt;- c(rowSums(runs))\nruns &lt;- cbind(runs, Total = total_runs)\n\n# Adding a new team(wreckers) row\nnew_team &lt;- c(0, 0, 0, 0) # no runs yet\nruns &lt;- rbind(runs, wreckers = new_team)\n\nrowSums(runs) calculates total runs for each team, cbind() adds that as a Total column, rbind() adds a new row for NewOpponents, wreckers, ready for when we record their stats in a future game.\n\n\nCalling the Plays: Extracting Specific Scores\nWe can pull specific data from the matrix, just like checking a scorecard. Take an instance where the coach wants to know what inning did the team perform best in offense achieving more runs or what inning our opponent scored most of their runs.\n\n#Runs scored by Thika Rangers in inning2\nruns[\"Thika Rangers\", \"Inning2\"]\n\n[1] 1\n\n#All runs scored by stommers in inning 3\nruns[\"MMU Stommers\", 3]\n\n[1] 3\n\n# All runs scored by Thika Rangers after inning 3\nruns[\"Thika Rangers\",]\n\nInning1 Inning2 Inning3   Total \n      2       1       0       3 \n\n\nIn this code, we start by extracting the runs scored by Thika Rangers in Inning 2 using runs[\"Thika Rangers\", \"Inning2\"], which uses both the row name \"Thika Rangers\" and the column name \"Inning2\" to return a single numeric value representing that inning’s score. Next, runs[\"MMU Stommers\", 3] selects the runs scored by MMU Stommers in Inning 3, but here instead of the column name we use the column index 3, which corresponds to \"Inning3\", showing how both names and numeric indices can be used for selection. Finally, runs[\"Thika Rangers\", ] retrieves all runs scored by Thika Rangers across all innings by specifying the row name and leaving the column index empty, meaning we keep the entire row as a vector of their inning-by-inning scores. This combination of row and column indexing is a powerful way to pinpoint or summarize specific performance data in R’s matrices.\n\n\nWrapping Up the Innings: What’s Next in the Series\nAs you have seen, matrices in R give us a powerful way to represent and manipulate baseball game data making it easy to extract insights, project future performance, and test “what if” scenarios.\nBut baseball isn’t just about the numbers, it’s also about what those numbers represent. In our next installment, we’ll move from raw numeric counts to factors, a statistical data type used to store categorical variables which in our case we will be representing categorical baseball data such as player positions, pitch types, or weather conditions during a game. Think of it as shifting focus from how many runs to what kind of plays shape the game because just like a well-timed home run, knowing the categories can be a game-changer."

    "title": "Learning R Through Baseball: Understanding Vectors One Hit at a Time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m starting a series to teach R programming, data science & eventually machine learning using baseball concepts a sport I play and umpire passionately (me in the black bandanna)in the Nairobi Baseball Community Series, representing the Thika Rangers Baseball Club. In this year’s regular season, we finished last in the league standings but majority of our games were close calls. That experience made me realize that we need more than just talent and effort. We need insight. I believe that using data can help us understand what’s really happening on the field and improve our performance. This series will document my learning journey and show how R can be used to analyze and improve baseball performance, one concept at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis first article is all about vectors, which are like the batting lineup of R simple, powerful, and foundational to everything else.\n\nBatter Up!… what exactly is a vector in R?\nIn simple terms, a vector is a collection of values. Think of it like a list of player names, jersey numbers, or the number of runs each player scored in a game all arranged in a straight line. In R, almost everything starts with a vector. If you want to do any data analysis, chances are you’ll be working with vectors a lot.\nTo create a vector in R, you use the c() function, which stands for “combine” or “concatenate”.\n\nplayers &lt;- c(\"Casper\", \"Moses\", \"Tuju\", \"Karani\", \"Steve\")\nruns_scored &lt;- c(2, 3, 2, 1, 4)\n\nIn this code: player is a variable name storing a character vector (a vector of names) representing player names of our teams’ game day roaster while runs_scored is a numeric vectors representing the runs scored.\n\n\nAll elements must be the same type\nOne thing I learned early on, is that all elements in a vector have to be of the same type. That means you can’t mix numbers, text, and TRUE/FALSE values in one vector at least not without R trying to convert everything to one type. Let me show an example:\n\nmixed &lt;- c(1, \"Hit\", TRUE)\nprint(mixed)\n\n[1] \"1\"    \"Hit\"  \"TRUE\"\n\n# [1] \"1\"   \"Hit\" \"TRUE\"\n\nR turns everything into a character (text) because that’s the most flexible type. That can lead to weird bugs if you don’t realize it’s happening, so it’s something you have to be extra keen on.\n\n\nVector types: The players in the team\nVectors come in different types, just like baseball players have different positions. Here are the main types :\n\nNumeric: Regular numbers like c(1, 2.5, 3)\nInteger: Whole numbers like c(1L, 2L, 3L)\nCharacter: Text like c(\"Pitcher\", \"Catcher\")\nLogical: is_home_team &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\nComplex and Raw stores complex numbers which include a real and an imaginary part (e.g., 2 + 3i). Imagine you’re modeling a pitch’s movement: the horizontal (x-axis) movement is the real part, and the vertical (y-axis) movement is the imaginary part. A complex number 3 + 2i might represent a fastball with 3 units of horizontal movement and 2 units of rise. This gives you a compact way of describing a two-dimensional pitch path.\n\n\n\nWhat can you do with vectors?\nThis is where vectors start to feel really powerful. You can do all sorts of operations on them and R handles it in a smart way.\n\nAccessing individual elements\n\n\nplayers[1]\n\n[1] \"Casper\"\n\n#Casper\n\nruns_scored[2]\n\n[1] 3\n\n#3\n\n2. Slicing: Getting multiple elements\n\nplayers[2:4]\n\n[1] \"Moses\"  \"Tuju\"   \"Karani\"\n\n# \"Moses\" \"Tuju\" \"Karani\"\n\n3. Filtering using conditions\n\nruns_scored[runs_scored &gt; 2]\n\n[1] 3 4\n\n# 3 4\n\n4. Doing arthmetic operation\n\nruns_scored &lt;- c(2, 3, 2, 1, 4)\nruns_scored * 2\n\n[1] 4 6 4 2 8\n\n# [1] 4 6 4 2 8\n\n5. Getting summary statistics\n\nsum(runs_scored)   # total runs\n\n[1] 12\n\nmean(runs_scored)  # average runs\n\n[1] 2.4\n\nmax(runs_scored)   # highest runs\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n6. Find the top performer based on runs scored in that game\n\nplayers[which.max(runs_scored)]\n\n[1] \"Steve\"\n\n# \"Steve\"\n\n\n\nGame scenario: game summary\nBelow I have player names and the number of runs each scored in game 8 of the regular season match\n\nplayers &lt;- c(\"Casper\", \"Moses\", \"Tuju\", \"Karani\", \"Steve\")\nruns_scored &lt;- c(2, 3, 2, 1, 4)\n\nUsing this data I can calculate the following:\n\nFind the total team runs: sum(runs)\nCalculate the average runs per player: mean(runs_scored)\nSee who scored no runs: players: players[runs_scored == 0]\nFind the MVP based on runs scored: players[which.max(runs_scored)]\n\n\n\nInning pointers\nVectors are everywhere in R and if you get comfortable with them, everything else gets easier. It’s important to pay attention to types. Mixing types inside a vector can mess things up and it’s worth noting that R is really good at handling operations on entire vectors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\nAs we’ve seen, vectors are the lead-off hitters of R setting the pace, laying the foundation, and always getting on base when it comes to data manipulation. Whether you’re dealing with game scores, player stats, or league standings, understanding how to create and manipulate vectors is a crucial skill.\nIn our next innings, we’ll dive deeper into how vectors interact with data frames and how to use them in analyzing real baseball data from the Thika Rangers Baseball club game stats.\nAnd with that, I’ll step behind the plate and make the call:\n\n\nThat’s the ball game!
